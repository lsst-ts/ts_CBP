CBP's configuration files are located in the `MTCalSys config repository <https://github.com/lsst-ts/ts_config_mtcalsys>`_.
The most pertinent fields are the masks values.
They take a name and rotation value, where the rotation value is the position angle the mask should be when placed in the beam.
